## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there is a correlation that exist between TotalProsperLoans and onTimeProsperPayments, this indicates that there is a positive relationship between the two variables. also I noticed that over 50% of people in our dataset currently on loan.

Employed people have more Propersrating score than Parttime and Retired meaning they have better chance of acquiring a loan.
